# TURN SWITCHING FIX - TEST INSTRUCTIONS

## Problem Identified:
- Host can click cards initially ✓
- After host's first move, both players get "Not your turn" ✗
- Turn switching wasn't working properly ✗

## Fix Applied:
1. **Only the current player sends turn switch messages**
2. **Receiving player waits for TURN: message**
3. **Better synchronization between host and client**

## Step-by-Step Test:

### Terminal 1 (HOST):
```powershell
java CrashCrave
```
1. Select "Host Multiplayer"
2. Enter name: "Host"
3. Wait for "Waiting for another player..." dialog
4. **Leave this running and open Terminal 2**

### Terminal 2 (CLIENT):
```powershell
java CrashCrave
```
1. Select "Join Multiplayer"
2. Enter name: "Client" 
3. Enter IP: "localhost"
4. Game should start

### Expected Debug Messages:

#### Host Console:
```
Game is ready! Host starts first.
Player Host clicked card 5
Host missed! Turn will switch after hiding cards.
Cards hidden, I switched the turn!
Turn switched to: Client, isMyTurn: false
Not your turn! Current player: Client
```

#### Client Console:
```
Not your turn! Current player: Host
Received TURN message: Client
Updated turn - Current: Client, isMyTurn: true
Player Client clicked card 8
Client missed! Turn will switch after hiding cards.
Cards hidden, I switched the turn!
Turn switched to: Host, isMyTurn: false
```

### Test Sequence:
1. **Host clicks 2 non-matching cards**
   - Should see miss message
   - Cards hide after 1.5 seconds
   - "Turn switched to: Client" message
   - Host gets "Not your turn!" when clicking

2. **Client clicks 2 non-matching cards**
   - Should see miss message
   - Cards hide after 1.5 seconds  
   - "Turn switched to: Host" message
   - Client gets "Not your turn!" when clicking

3. **Host clicks 2 matching cards**
   - Should see match message
   - Cards stay visible
   - Host continues (no turn switch)

## If Still Not Working:

Check for these messages in console:
- "Game is ready!" - confirms game started
- "Turn switched to:" - confirms turn switching
- "Received TURN message:" - confirms network sync
- "Not your turn!" - confirms turn blocking

The fix ensures only the active player can send turn switches to avoid conflicts!
