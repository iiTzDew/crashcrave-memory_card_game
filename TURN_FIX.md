## Turn Management Fix - Multiplayer Game

### Problem Fixed:
- Player 2 completes turn → Player 1 gets turn → Player 1 could continue indefinitely
- Turn switching was not properly synchronized between players

### Solution Applied:

1. **Match Logic:**
   - If player makes a match → they continue playing (no turn switch)
   - If player misses → turn switches to opponent

2. **Network Synchronization:**
   - `MATCH:true` → Current player continues
   - `MATCH:false` → Turn switches after cards are hidden

3. **Turn Switching:**
   - Only happens when cards are hidden after a miss
   - Both players get synchronized turn state via network messages

### How to Test:

**Terminal 1 (Host):**
```powershell
java CrashCrave
# Select "Host Multiplayer" → Enter name → Wait
```

**Terminal 2 (Client):**
```powershell
java CrashCrave
# Select "Join Multiplayer" → Enter name → Enter "localhost"
```

### Expected Behavior:
1. Host starts first
2. If host makes match → host continues
3. If host misses → client gets turn
4. If client makes match → client continues  
5. If client misses → host gets turn
6. Turns alternate properly on misses only

### Test Scenario:
1. Player 1 makes a move (miss) → Player 2's turn
2. Player 2 makes a move (miss) → Player 1's turn
3. Player 1 makes a move (match) → Player 1 continues
4. Player 1 makes a move (miss) → Player 2's turn
5. And so on...

The turn management is now properly synchronized!
