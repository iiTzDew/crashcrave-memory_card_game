## Debug Guide - Player 1 Not Working Issue

### Testing Steps:

1. **Start Host (Player 1):**
   ```powershell
   java CrashCrave
   # Select "Host Multiplayer"
   # Enter name (e.g., "Alice")
   # Wait for connection dialog
   ```

2. **Start Client (Player 2):**
   ```powershell
   java CrashCrave
   # Select "Join Multiplayer"  
   # Enter name (e.g., "Bob")
   # Enter "localhost" for IP
   ```

### Expected Debug Output:

**Host Console:**
- Should show player Alice can click cards
- "Player Alice clicked card X" messages

**Client Console:**  
- Should show "Not your turn! Current player: Alice"
- When Alice misses, should show "Turn switched to: Bob"

### Key Fixes Applied:

1. **Clear Player Roles:**
   - Host = Player 1 (starts first)
   - Client = Player 2 (waits for turn)

2. **Turn Management:**
   - Only LocalPlayer can click during their turn
   - RemotePlayer moves come via network

3. **Debug Output:**
   - Shows whose turn it is
   - Shows when turns switch
   - Shows click attempts

### If Still Not Working:

Check console output for:
- "Game not ready yet..." → Cards still showing
- "Not your turn!" → Turn management issue
- No click messages → Event handler issue

### Single Player Test:
If multiplayer fails, test single player:
```powershell
java CrashCrave
# Select "Single Player"
# Should work normally
```
