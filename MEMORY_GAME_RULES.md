# Memory Game Turn Logic - Fixed Implementation

## Correct Game Rules Implemented:

### Rule 1: Match = Continue Playing
- When a player selects 2 matching cards
- That player scores +1 point
- **Same player gets another turn immediately**
- No turn switch occurs

### Rule 2: Miss = Turn Switch
- When a player selects 2 non-matching cards
- Cards are shown briefly (1.5 seconds)
- Cards are hidden again
- **Turn switches to the other player**

### Rule 3: Continuous Loop Until Match
- Players alternate turns on misses
- Host → Client → Host → Client (on misses)
- Loop continues until someone gets a match
- Match winner continues until they miss

## Expected Gameplay Flow:

### Scenario 1: Host Starts
1. **Host plays, MISSES** → Client's turn
2. **Client plays, MISSES** → Host's turn  
3. **Host plays, MISSES** → Client's turn
4. **Client plays, MATCHES** → Client continues
5. **Client plays, MATCHES** → Client continues
6. **Client plays, MISSES** → Host's turn
7. **Host plays, MATCHES** → Host continues
8. And so on...

## Testing Instructions:

### Terminal 1 (Host):
```powershell
java CrashCrave
# Select "Host Multiplayer"
# Enter name: "Alice"
# Wait for connection
```

### Terminal 2 (Client):
```powershell
java CrashCrave
# Select "Join Multiplayer"  
# Enter name: "Bob"
# Enter "localhost"
```

## Console Debug Messages:

### Expected Output:
- `"Game is ready! Alice starts first."`
- `"Player Alice clicked card X"`
- `"Alice missed! Turn will switch."`
- `"Cards hidden, turn switched!"`
- `"Turn switched to: Bob, isMyTurn: false"`
- `"Not your turn! Current player: Bob"` (on Alice's console)
- `"Player Bob clicked card Y"`
- `"Bob got a match! They continue playing."`
- `"Bob got a match and continues!"` (on Alice's console)

## Key Fixes Applied:

1. **Match Logic**: Player continues on match, no turn switch
2. **Miss Logic**: Always switch turns after hiding cards
3. **Network Sync**: Both players get consistent turn updates
4. **Debug Output**: Clear messages showing turn flow

## Test Sequence:

1. **Host clicks 2 non-matching cards**
   - Should see miss message
   - Cards hide after 1.5 seconds
   - Client gets turn

2. **Client clicks 2 non-matching cards**
   - Should see miss message  
   - Cards hide after 1.5 seconds
   - Host gets turn back

3. **Host clicks 2 matching cards**
   - Should see match message
   - Cards stay visible
   - Host gets another turn immediately

This implements the standard memory card game rules perfectly!
