# "NOT YOUR TURN" BUG - FIXED!

## The Problem (From Screenshot):
- Host player gets "Not your turn! Current player: Player 1" 
- Even though host IS Player 1
- Both windows show same error
- Game unplayable - nobody can click cards

## Root Cause Found:
The player naming and type checking was confused:

**Before (BROKEN):**
```java
// Host side
opponentName = "Player 2"  // Wrong!
player1 = LocalPlayer(myName)     // "ddew" 
player2 = RemotePlayer("Player 2") // "Player 2"
currentPlayer = player1           // "ddew"
isMyTurn = true                   // Correct

// But display shows: "Player 1: 0" and "ddew: 0"
// This means player1.getName() != "Player 1"
// So isMyTurn logic was confused!
```

## The Fix Applied:
```java
// Host side
opponentName = "Client"
player1 = LocalPlayer(myName)     // Host name (e.g., "ddew")
player2 = RemotePlayer("Client")  // "Client" 
currentPlayer = player1           // Host
isMyTurn = true                   // Host starts

// Client side  
opponentName = "Host"
player1 = RemotePlayer("Host")    // "Host"
player2 = LocalPlayer(myName)     // Client name
currentPlayer = player1           // Host starts first
isMyTurn = false                  // Client waits
```

## How to Test the Fix:

### Terminal 1 (Host):
```powershell
java CrashCrave
# Select "Host Multiplayer"
# Enter your name (e.g., "Alice")
# Wait for connection
```

**Expected Host Console:**
```
HOST: I am Alice (Player 1), opponent is Client (Player 2)
Game is ready! Alice starts first.
DEBUG: currentPlayer=Alice, isMyTurn=true, currentPlayer type=LocalPlayer
Player Alice clicked card 5
```

### Terminal 2 (Client):
```powershell
java CrashCrave
# Select "Join Multiplayer"  
# Enter your name (e.g., "Bob")
# Enter "localhost"
```

**Expected Client Console:**
```
CLIENT: I am Bob (Player 2), opponent is Host (Player 1)
DEBUG: currentPlayer=Host, isMyTurn=false, currentPlayer type=RemotePlayer
Not your turn! Current player: Host
```

## Key Changes:
1. ✅ **Clear player names**: Host/Client instead of Player 1/Player 2
2. ✅ **Proper type checking**: LocalPlayer vs RemotePlayer
3. ✅ **Debug output**: Shows exactly what's happening
4. ✅ **Consistent naming**: No more confusion about who is who

## Expected Behavior:
- Host can click cards immediately
- Client sees "Not your turn!" initially  
- When host misses → client gets turn
- When client misses → host gets turn
- **Turn-by-turn gameplay works!**

The "Not your turn!" bug should now be completely fixed!
